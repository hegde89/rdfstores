Supported queries:
	•	Keyword query: keywords as string
	•	Structured query: triple graph pattern (conjunctive query, SPARQL subset)
	•	Hybrid query: combination of keyword and structured query

Interface is JSON-based, access through POST method

For keyword and hybrid query, the number of interpretations to be returned and evaluated can be specified.

Requests
Requests are specified in the body of a POST request.

Keyword query request:
{
	“keyword-query”: “keyword1 keyword2”,

	“translation”: {
		“interpretations”: “all”,	# number of interpretations to return or ‘all’
		“with-results”: 1			# number of interpretations to return results for or ‘all’
	}
}

Structured query request:
{
	“structured-query”: {
		“select-variables”: [“?x”, “?y”],
		“triple-patterns”: [
			[“?x”, “authorof”, “?y”],
			[“?x”, “name”, “john doe”]
		]
	}
}

Hybrid query request:
{
	“keyword-query”: “keyword1 keyword2”,

	“translation”: {
		“interpretations”: “all”,
		“with-results”: “1”
	},

	“structured-query”: {
		“select-variables”: [“?x”, “?y”],
		“triple-patterns”: [
			[“?x”, “authorof”, “?y”],
			[“?x”, “name”, “john doe”]
		]
	}
}

Basically, if both keyword-query and structured query are specified, the request is treated as a hybrid query. For hybrid queries, the structured query is of course also taken into account.

Response

Structured query:
{
	“columns” : [“x”, “y”],
	
	“rows”: [
		[“a”, “b”],
		[“d”, “e”]
	]
}

Keyword and Hybrid query:
{
	“interpretations”: [
		{
			“structured-query”: {
				“select-variables”: [“?x”, “?y”],
				“triple-patterns”: [
					[“?x”, “authorof”, “?y”],
					[“?x”, “name”, “john doe”]
				]
			}
			“result”: {
				“columns” : [“x”, “y”],
	
				“rows”: [
					[“a”, “b”],
					[“d”, “e”]
				]
			}
		},
		{
			“structured-query”: .... # as above
		}
	]
}
