\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a first solution towards a systematic optimization of
Linked Data queries. In particular, we propose an optimization
framework for Linked Data query processing, which incorporates both,
standard query operators and source selection. Our framework supports
the joint optimization of several objectives, such as cost and output
cardinality. To support optimization of multiple objectives, we extend
the classic dynamic programming solution to a multi-objective query
optimization solution that generates the Pareto-set of optimal query
plans, representing the trade-off between optimization
objectives. Further, we support sharing of source scan operators and
provide bounds on plan cost to ensure the optimality of the dynamic
programming algorithm in this case. In several experiments we compare
our solution to baselines and show that our approach improves on the
baselines by generating the complete Pareto-set of optimal plans and
producing plans that have lower costs for the same number of results.

Future work lies in two main areas. The cardinality and cost
estimation of combinations of sources should be improved to take
dependencies between sources into account. The high complexity of the
multi-objective dynamic programming algorithm necessitates
investigation of approximative algorithms.
