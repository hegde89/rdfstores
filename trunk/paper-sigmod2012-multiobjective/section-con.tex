\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We propose a first solution towards a systematic optimization of
Linked Data queries with an optimization framework for Linked Data
query processing, which incorporates both, standard query operators
and source selection. In order to support joint optimization of
multiple, conflicting objectives, such as cost and output cardinality,
we extend the classic dynamic programming solution for query
optimization to the multi-objective setting. The result is the Pareto
set of optimal query plans, representing the trade-off between the
optimization objectives. Further, we support sharing of source scan
operators and provide bounds on plan costs to ensure the optimality of
the dynamic programming algorithm. In experiments we compare our
solution to baselines and show that our approach improves on the
baselines by generating the complete Pareto set of optimal plans and
producing plans improve performance for the same number of results.

As future work, we consider the improvement of the cardinality and
cost estimation by taking dependencies between sources into account
and approximating the optimization algorithm to alleviate its high
complexity.
