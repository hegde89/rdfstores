\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:eva}
%Existing work on Linked Data query processing performs source ranking without further optimization. We implements a baseline, which uses the source ranking strategy to select sources first, and then uses dynamic programming for optimizing the cost of subsequent query operators. 


The evaluation of our approach consists of two parts. In the first, we
evalute the benefit of using the dynamic programming query
optimization algorithm for Linked Data query processing in a
single-objective scenario. In the second part, we focus on the
multi-objective optimization approach proposed in this paper.

%\subsection{Multi-objective Optimization with Dynamic Programming}

In the second part of the evaluation we examine the approach for
multi-objective optimization of Linked Data queries that was presented
in this paper. We will examine whether the dynamic programming
approach is effective and compare it with two baselines to assess the
quality of the generated plans.

\subsection{Systems}
\textbf{Our Approach.} We implemented two versions of our
approach. The first version (DP) implements all the proposed techniques to produce the complete set of Pareto-optimal plans. The second
version (DPU) also uses operator sharing such that for subsequent source accesses, the refined cost model applies. However, the effect of this is not taken into account during pruning.  That is, it uses directly the cost instead of the lower and upper bounds that have been established to guarantee monotonicity of cost. Thus, at the cost of compromising Pareto-optimality, DPU can prune more aggressively and thus, is expected to exhibit better performance. With this baseline, we aim to study the positive effect of using the proposed bounds on Pareto-optimality, and to find out whether the proposed technique for estimating the bounds is effective in reducing the overhead resulting from that.


\textbf{Baselines.} Existing Linked Data approaches implement ad-hoc source ranking to select few best sources~\cite{harth_data_2010,ladwig_linked_2010}, and then process these sources without further optimization. This processing represents one single plan, whose optimality is unknown. We implement this source ranking (RK) and a random source selection strategy (RD). Given the selected sources, the standard DP solution is applied on top to optimize the cost these baselines need to produce results from these sources. In the same way proposed for our approach, this DP solution applies operator sharing so that sources can be reused. Instead of one single cost-optimized plan, our approach however yields a Pareto-set of query plans that represents the trade-off between cost and cardinality. Thus, we further extend these baselines to use different combinations of sources that yield different plans. 

Both baselines first retrieve all relevant sources $D$ for a query $Q$
from the source index, i.e., $D = \bigcup_{t \in Q} source(t)$. Then, a set $\mathcal{D}$ containing $|D|$ different subsets of $D$, each with size in the range $[1,|D|]$ is created. 
%The number of  captured by and $|\mathcal{D}| = |D|$. 
The baselines differ in how these
subsets are selected:
\begin{itemize}
\item Baseline RD randomly selects the $|D|$ subsets.
\item Baseline RK first ranks sources in $D$ by the number of
  contained triples that match query triple patterns, calculated as
  $score(d) = \sum_{t \in q} card_d(t)$. The subsets are created
  by starting with the highest ranked source and then successively
  adding sources in the order of their rank to obtain $|D|$ subsets in
  total.
\end{itemize}
Each element in $\mathcal{D}$ is a subset of all relevant source and
represents a combination of sources. For each of the source
combinations, we create a single cost-optimized query plan. As a result, we have a set of plans, which vary in the number of results as well as because different combination of sources are used. 
% using a standard dynamic
%programming optimizer (i.e., no multi-objective optimization). Sharing
%of source scan operators is also employed where possible.

Note that our approach not only selects sources (source scan operators) but also for which triple patterns these sources are used (selection operators), while the sources selected for the baselines are used for all triple patterns. In order to obtain even more plans that further vary in the number of results they produce, we create an additional set of $m$ plans for each
previously created plan by randomly removing a subset of the inputs (selection operators) from the unions at the root of their access plans. 
%In particular, to create a new plan from an
%existing plan, for each union that is root of an access plan, we
%remove a random subset of its input (selection) operators. 
%If the source scan operator that is input for a removed selection operator is
%not shared it is also remove from the plan.
%Any invalid plans that are constructed in this way (e.g., all inputs of an union might have been) are discarded. 
In the end, each baseline
has at most of $m \cdot |D|$ plans that vary in terms of results (where only $|D|$ plans actually vary in terms of cost). 

These baselines optimize source selection independent from the subsequent computation of results. While the goal of source selection is to choose those that contribute many results, the subsequent optimization focuses on cost. Compared to them, our approach not only jointly optimize sources section and result computation but also, considers cardinality and cost at the same time. Our goal is to study the effect of this joint optimization on the Pareto-optimality of plans. Further, we will investigate the effect of using non-optimal plans on the result....
%While this effect is expected to be positive, the increased complexity of the planning problem also leads to additional cost. Thus, we will also investigate whether this overhead can be justified by looking at the total processing time needed for producing several fixed fraction of results.  


\textbf{Parameters.} Parameter $b$ specifies the benefit that is
assumed during query planning for sharing of source scan
operators. For example, with $b=0.8$ the planners assume that 80\% of
the source scan cost is saved, i.e., second and subsequent reads of a
source scan operator cost only 20\% of the first read.

For RD and RK, parameter $m$ describes the number of additional plans
that were generated by randomly remove selection and source scan
operators.

\subsection{Datasets and Queries}

We created 14 BGP queries of different sizes w.r.t. to the number of
triple patterns. We executed all queries using a link traversal
approach and recorded all retrieved sources. This dataset was then
indexed in a source index and used for the evaluation. The dataset
consists of 1,909,109 triples and contains data from various popular
open datasets, such as DBpedia, Freebase, New York Times, GeoNames,
LinkedMDB and others. Table~\ref{tab:queries} shows various
statistics for all evaluation queries.

As the source index contained too many sources for the multi-objective
optimization approach to deal with, we randomly aggregated sources
during the creation of access plans into a set of $k=5$ virtual
sources. The size of the virtual sources follows a Zipf distribution.

\subsection{Setting}
All systems were implemented in Java. The query planner is
single-threaded, whereas the execution engine uses multiple
threads. All experiments were executed on a 2009 Macbook Pro with a
2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, 4GB RAM (of which 1GB was assigned
to the Java VM) and a Crucial m4 128GB solid-state disk.


\subsection{Results}

\textbf{Overall.} Fig.~\ref{fig:queries}a shows an overview over all
evaluation queries and displays the number of plans that were
generated by each system, split into skyline and non-skyline (i.e.,
dominated) plans. The number of skyline plans was determined by
collecting all plans of a particular query for all systems in one set
and then pruning all dominated plans. 

We can see that DP produces only skyline plans and that there are many
DPU plans that are part of the skyline (56\% on average). However, the
RD and RD baselines generate almost no skyline plans (3\% and 1\% on
average). 

Fig.~\ref{fig:queries}b shows the skyline fraction (i.e., the fraction
of the DP skyline) found by RD and RK for different values of $m$. We
see that for larger values of $m$ the skyline fraction is higher,
i.e., the larger plan space created by randomly removing union inputs
is necessary to find skyline plans.

\textbf{Effect of Query Size.} Figs.~\ref{fig:pareto_tp}a+b show the
planning time and found skyline fraction for different query sizes
(i.e., number of triple patterns). An increased number of triple
patterns results in a larger search space for the query optimizer: for
all systems planning time increases with the number of triple
patterns. However, the DP algorithm is much more affected than DPU, RK
and RD. Going from 3 to 5 triple patterns, the planning time of DP
increases by a factor of 87.7 while the planning time for DPU only
increases by a factor of 16, and RD and RK are largely unaffected. The
high increase in planning time for 5 triple patterns is largely due to
query Q16. Without Q16, the factors decrease to 54.9 and 10.5 for DP
and DPU, respectively.

Fig.~\ref{fig:pareto_tp}b shows the fractions of the complete plan
skyline (i.e., the plans computed by DP) that the systems are able to
calculate for different query sizes. Whereas for 3 triple patterns the
baselines RD and RK are able to find 17\% and 6\% of the skyline, no
skyline plans are found for 4 and 5 triple patterns. DPU also performs
better for 3 triple patterns, where 70\% of the skyline is found (54\%
for 4 and 5 triple patterns). For more triple patterns the space of
possible plans is much larger, which is why especially the baselines
perform much worse.

    fractions ($b=0.8, m=2000$).}
  \label{fig:pareto_tp}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Effect of Sharing Benefit.} Figs.~\ref{fig:pareto_sharing}a+b
show the planning time and skyline fractions for different values of
$b$. We see in Fig.~\ref{fig:pareto_sharing}a that the planning time
for DP increases with higher sharing benefits: from 37.63s for $b=0.1$
to 50.1s for $b=0.8$. However, the planning time for the other
approaches, DPU, RD, and RK, remain the same for all values of
$b$. The planning time for DP increases with higher sharing benefits
because the bounds of plan costs are less tight and less plans can be
pruned during the query optimization process. The other approaches are
not affected because DP is the only one that actually considers the
sharing benefit during optimization.

Fig.~\ref{fig:pareto_sharing}b shows the skyline fractions for all
approaches for different values of $b$. We can see that DPU computes a
larger part of the skyline when the sharing benefit is lower. This is
due to the fact that DPU does not take the effect of operating sharing
into account, leading to worse results the more pronounved the
influence of the sharing benefit is. The other approaches, RD and RK,
are not affected by the sharing benefit as the benefit is not taken
into account during planning.

    skyline fractions ($m=2000$).}

\end{figure}

\textbf{Plan Skyline.} Figs.~\ref{fig:pareto_q2_skyline}a+b show a scatter
plot of cost and cardinality of plans generated by all systems for
query Q2. In these plots a plan dominates all plans that are to its
lower right, i.e. that have higher cost (x-axis) and lower cardinality
(y-axis). Fig.~\ref{fig:pareto_q2_skyline}a shows all plans that were
generated by the different systems. We can immediately see that many
of the plans generated by the RD and RK baselines are dominated by
other plans. Fig.~\ref{fig:pareto_q2_skyline}b shows only the plans
for all systems that are on the skyline. Here, the dominated plans in
the center of the plot no longer appear and only few RD and RK plans
remain.

    skyline plans ($b=0.8,m=2000$).}
  \label{fig:pareto_q2_skyline}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Execution Time.}  Fig.~\ref{fig:exec_q7} shows the execution
times and number of results for 10\% of plans (randomly chosen) for
query Q7 generated by DP. We see that plans that produce less results
in general have shorter execution times. In order to find all 106
query results, the fastest plan takes 17.9 seconds; producing a subset
of 46 results requires only 4.3 seconds.

However, we can also see that some of the plans produce no results at
all. This is due to the fact that the employed cardinality estimation
procedure does not take dependencies between sources into
account. Here, a more sophisticated method for cardinality estimation
would help avoid generting empty plans.
