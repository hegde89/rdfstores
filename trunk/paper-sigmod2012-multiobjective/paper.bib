problems for traditional query processing techniques as data
access becomes less predictable due to link congestion, load

is a promising approach to coping with unpredictability in

arrival properties of the data. We have developed a
non-blocking join operator, called {XJoin,} which has a small
memory footprint, allowing many such operators to be active
in parallel. {XJoin} is optimized to produce initial results
quickly and can hide intermittent delays in data arrival by
reactively scheduling background processing. We show that
{XJoin} is an effective solution for providing fast query

	abstract = {Query optimizers nowadays draw upon many sources of information about the database to optimize queries. They employ runtime statistics in cost-based estimation of query plans. They employ integrity constraints in the query rewrite process. Primary and foreign key constraints have long played a role in the optimizer, both for rewrite opportunities and for providing more accurate cost predictions. More recently, other types of integrity constraints are being exploited by optimizers in commercial systems, for which certain semantic query optimization techniques have now been implemented.
These new optimization strategies that exploit constraints hold the promise for good improvement. Their weakness, however, is that often the “constraints” that would be useful for optimization for a given database and workload are not explicitly available for the optimizer. Data mining tools can find such “constraints” that are true of the database, but then there is the question of how this information can be kept by the database system, and how to make this information available to, and effectively usable by, the optimizer.
We present our work on soft constraints in {DB2.} A soft constraint is a syntactic statement equivalent to an integrity constraint declaration. A soft constraint is not really a constraint, per se, since future updates may undermine it. While a soft constraint is valid, however, it can be used by the optimizer in the same way integrity constraints are. We present two forms of soft constraint: absolute and statistical. An absolute soft constraint is consistent with respect to the current state of the database, just in the same way an integrity constraint must be. They can be used in rewrite, as well as in cost estimation. A statistical soft constraint differs in that it may have some degree of violation with respect to the state of the database. Thus, statistical soft constraints cannot be used in rewrite, but they can still be used in cost estimation.
We are working long-term on absolute soft constraints. We discuss the issues involved in implementing a facility for absolute soft constraints in a database system (and in {DB2),} and the strategies that we are researching. The current {DB2} optimizer is more amenable to adding facilities for statistical soft constraints. In the short-term, we have been implementing pathways in the optimizer for statistical soft constraints. We discuss this implementation.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of finding efficient equivalent view-based rewritings of relational queries, focusing on query optimization using materialized views under the assumption that base relations cannot contain duplicate tuples. A lot of work in the literature addresses the problems of answering queries using views and query optimization. However, most of it proposes solutions for special cases, such as for conjunctive queries {(CQs)} or for aggregate queries only. In addition, most of it addresses the problems separately under set or bag-set semantics for query evaluation, and some of it proposes heuristics without formal proofs for completeness or soundness. In this paper we look at the two problems by considering {CQ/A} queries - that is, both pure conjunctive and aggregate queries, with aggregation functions {SUM,} {COUNT,} {MIN,} and {MAX;} the {DISTINCT} keyword in {(SQL} versions of) our queries is also allowed. We build on past work to provide algorithms that handle this general setting. This is possible because recent results on rewritings of {CQ/A} queries [1, 8] show that there are sound and complete algorithms based on containment tests of {CQs.Our} focus is that our algorithms are efficient as well as sound and complete. Besides the contribution we make in putting and addressing the problems in this general setting, we make two additional contributions for bag-set and set semantics. First, we propose efficient sound and complete tests for equivalence of {CQ/A} queries to rewritings that use overlapping views (the algorithms are complete with respect to the language of rewritings). These results apply not only to query optimization, but to all areas where the goal is to obtain efficient equivalent view-based query rewritings. Second, based on these results we propose two sound algorithms, {BDPV} and {CDPV,} that find efficient execution plans for {CQ/A} queries in terms of materialized views. Both algorithms extend the cost-based query-optimization approach of System R [19]. The efficient sound algorithm {BDPV} is also complete in some cases, whereas {CDPV} is sound and complete for all {CQ/A} queries we consider. We present a study of the completeness-efficiency tradeoff in the algorithms, and provide experimental results that show the viability of our approach and test the limits of query optimization using overlapping views.},

During the acquisition phase, each computer is assumed to randomly sample a subset of the entire collection. During retrieval, the query is issued to a random subset of computers, each of which returns its results to the query-issuer, who consolidates the results. We examine how the number of computers, and the fraction of the collection that each computer indexes, affects performance in comparison to a traditional deterministic configuration. We provide analytic formulae that, given the number of computers and the fraction of the collection each computer indexes, provide the probability of an approximately correct search, where a "correct search" is defined to be the result of a deterministic search on the entire collection. We show that the randomized distributed search algorithm can have acceptable performance under a range of parameters settings. Simulation results confirm our analysis.},

We implemented several techniques to visualize and explore hot spots in the graph, i.e. nodes with large numbers of immediate neighbors. In response to the user-controlled, semantics-driven direction of the exploration, the {PGV} explorer obtains the necessary sub-graphs from the {RDF} pager and enables their incremental visualization leaving the previously laid out sub-graphs intact.

In this case, the query optimizer will generate a more efficient plan based on the current statistics. The online transition from the old to the new plan is called dynamic plan migration. In addition to correctness, an effective technique for dynamic plan migration should achieve the following objectives: 1) minimize the memory and {CPU} overhead of the migration, 2) reduce the duration of the transition, and 3) maintain a steady output rate. The only known solutions for this problem are the moving states {(MS)} and parallel track {(PT)} strategies, which have some serious shortcomings related to the above objectives. Motivated by these shortcomings, we first propose {HybMig,} which combines the merits of {MS} and {PT} and outperforms both in every aspect. As a second step, we extend {PT,} {MS,} and {HybMig} to the general problem of migration, where both the new and the old plans are treated as black boxes.},

	abstract = {Despite the intense interest towards realizing the Semantic Web vision, most existing {RDF} data management schemes are constrained in terms of efficiency and scalability. Still, the growing popularity of the {RDF} format arguably calls for an effort to offset these drawbacks. Viewed from a relational-database perspective, these constraints are derived from the very nature of the {RDF} data model, which is based on a triple format. Recent research has attempted to address these constraints using a vertical-partitioning approach, in which separate two-column tables are constructed for each property. However, as we show, this approach suffers from similar scalability drawbacks on queries that are not bound by {RDF} property value. In this paper, we propose an {RDF} storage scheme that uses the triple nature of {RDF} as an asset. This scheme enhances the vertical partitioning idea and takes it to its logical conclusion. {RDF} data is indexed in six possible ways, one for each possible ordering of the three {RDF} elements. Each instance of an {RDF} element is associated with two vectors; each such vector gathers elements of one of the other types, along with lists of the third-type resources attached to each vector element. Hence, a sextuple-indexing scheme emerges. This format allows for quick and scalable general-purpose query processing; it confers significant advantages (up to five orders of magnitude) compared to previous approaches for {RDF} data management, at the price of a worst-case five-fold increase in index space. We experimentally document the advantages of our approach on real-world and synthetic data sets with practical queries.},

We show that Mariposa's greedy heuristic can be arbitrarily far from the desired optimum. Applying a recent approach in multiobjective optimization algorithms to this problem, we show that the optimum cost-delay trade-off {(Pareto)} curve in Mariposa's framework can be approximated fast within any desired accuracy.

	abstract = {Integrated access to multiple distributed and autonomous {RDF} data sources is a key challenge for many semantic web applications.
As a reaction to this challenge, {SPARQL,} the {W3C} Recommendation for an {RDF} query language, supports querying of multiple {RDF}
graphs. However, the current standard does not provide transparent query federation, which makes query formulation hard and
lengthy. Furthermore, current implementations of {SPARQL} load all {RDF} graphs mentioned in a query to the local machine. This
usually incurs a large overhead in network traffic, and sometimes is simply impossible for technical or legal reasons. To
overcome these problems we present {DARQ,} an engine for federated {SPARQL} queries. {DARQ} provides transparent query access to
multiple {SPARQL} services, i.e., it gives the user the impression to query one single {RDF} graph despite the real data being
distributed on the web. A service description language enables the query engine to decompose a query into sub-queries, each
of which can be answered by an individual service. {DARQ} also uses query rewriting and cost-based query optimization to speed-up
query execution. Experiments show that these optimizations significantly improve query performance even when only a very limited
amount of statistical information is available. {DARQ} is available under {GPL} License at

it is difficult to produce efficient database query plans based on information available solely at compile time. A solution
to this problem is to exploit information that becomes available at query runtime and adapt the query plan to changing conditions
during execution. This paper presents a survey on adaptive query processing techniques, examining the opportunities they offer
to modify a plan dynamically and classifying them into categories according to the problem they focus on, their objectives,
the nature of feedback they collect from the environment, the frequency at which they can adapt, their implementation environment

This failure is even more acute in the context of {XQuery,} due to the structured nature of the {XML} language. To overcome the vulnerabilities of traditional optimizers, we have previously proposed {ROX,} a Run-time Optimizer for {XQueries,} which interleaves optimization and execution of full tables. {ROX} has proved to be robust, even in the presence of strong correlations, but it has one limitation: it uses full materialization of intermediate results making it unsuitable for pipelined systems. Therefore, this paper proposes {ROX-sampled,} a variant of {ROX,} which executes small data samples, thus generating smaller intermediates. We conduct extensive experiments which proved that {ROX-sampled} is comparable to {ROX} in performance, and that it is still robust against correlations. The main benefit of {ROX-sampled} is that it allows the large number of pipelined databases to import the {ROX} idea into their optimization paradigm.},

Currently there are several cloud computing products that can provide various services. However, currently the cloud platforms only support simple keyword-based queries and can't answer complex queries efficiently due to lack of efficient index techniques. In this paper we propose an efficient approach to build multi-dimensional index for Cloud computing system. We use the combination of R-tree and {KD-tree} to organize data records and offer fast query processing and efficient index maintenance. Our approach can process typical multi-dimensional queries including point queries and range queries efficiently. Besides, frequent change of data on big amount of machines makes the index maintenance a challenging problem, and to cope with this problem we proposed a cost estimation-based index update strategy that can effectively update the index structure. Our experiments show that our indexing techniques improve query efficiency by an order of magnitude compared with alternative approaches, and scale well with the size of the data. Our approach is quite general and independent from the underlying infrastructure and can be easily carried over for implementation on various Cloud computing platforms.},

In this paper, we investigate combining the two with the hopes of creating an approach that provides the best of both. Specifically, we propose to take as input a target database and then generate and index a set of query forms offline. At query time, a user with a question to be answered issues standard keyword search queries; but instead of returning tuples, the system returns forms relevant to the question. The user may then build a structured query with one of these forms and submit it back to the system for evaluation. In this paper, we address challenges that arise in form generation, keyword search over forms, and ranking and displaying these forms. We explore techniques to tackle these challenges, and present experimental results suggesting that the approach of combining keyword search and form-based interfaces is promising.},

Since these requirements pose a problem to lay or occasional users, several methods incorporate keyword search {(KS)} into relational databases. However, most of the existing techniques focus on querying a single {DBMS.} On the other hand, the proliferation of distributed databases in several conventional and emerging applications necessitates the support for keyword-based data sharing and querying over multiple {DMBSs.} In order to avoid the high cost of searching in numerous, potentially irrelevant, databases in such systems, we propose {G-KS,} a novel method for selecting the {top-K} candidates based on their potential to contain results for a given query. {G-KSsummarizes} each database by a keyword relationship graph, where nodes represent terms and edges describe relationships between them. Keyword relationship graphs are utilized for computing the similarity between each database and a {KS} query, so that, during query processing, only the most promising databases are searched. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that {G-KS} outperforms the current state-of-the-art technique on all aspects, including precision, recall, efficiency, space overhead and flexibility of accommodating different semantics.},

Current techniques for supporting such queries on general graphs suffer from several drawbacks, e.g., poor worst-case performance, not taking full advantage of indexes, and high memory requirements. To address these problems, we propose {BLINKS,} a bi-level indexing and query processing scheme for top-k keyword search on graphs. {BLINKS} follows a search strategy with provable performance bounds, while additionally exploiting a bi-level index for pruning and accelerating the search. To reduce the index space, {BLINKS} partitions a data graph into blocks: The bi-level index stores summary information at the block level to initiate and guide search among blocks, and more detailed information for each block to accelerate search within blocks. Our experiments show that {BLINKS} offers orders-of-magnitude performance improvement over existing approaches.},

example, to facilitate interoperability between heterogeneous applications. Such applications may update the {XML} document

recursively defined {XML} views of relations. We propose new optimization techniques to efficiently support {XML} view updates
specified via an {XPATH} expression with recursion and complex filters. The main novelties of our techniques are: (1) we propose
a space-efficient relational encoding of recursive {XML} views; and (2) we push the bulk of update processing inside a relational
database. Specifically, a compressed representation of the {XML} views is stored as extended shared-inlining relations. A space-efficient
and updatable 2-hop index is used to optimize {XPATH} evaluation on {XML} views. Updates of the {XML} views are evaluated on these relations and index.
View update translation is handled by a heuristic procedure inside a relational database, as opposed to previous middleware
approaches. We present an experimental study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed techniques.},

However, most of the current research work focuses on keyword-based searching over a single structured data source. With the growing interest in distributed databases and service oriented architecture over the Internet, it is important to extend such a capability over multiple structured data sources. One of the most important problems for enabling such a query facility is to be able to select the most useful data sources relevant to the keyword query. Traditional database summary techniques used for selecting unstructured datasources developed in {IR} literature are inadequate for our problem, as they do not capture the structure of the data sources. In this paper, we study the database selection problem for relational data sources, and propose a method that effectively summarizes the relationships between keywords in a relational database based on its structure. We develop effective ranking methods based on the keyword relationship summaries in order to select the most useful databases for a given keyword query. We have implemented our system on {PlanetLab.} In that environment we use extensive experiments with real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed summarization method.},

These either rely on a cost model which might result in inaccurate estimations, or explore only a restrictive number of plans from the search space. {ROX} is developed to tackle these problems. {ROX} does not need any cost model, and defers query optimization to run-time intertwining optimization and execution steps. In every optimization step, sampling techniques are used to estimate the cardinality of unexecuted steps and joins to make a decision which sequence of operators to process next. Consequently, each execution step will provide updated and accurate knowledge about intermediate results, which will be used during the next optimization round. This demonstration will focus on: (i) illustrating the steps that {ROX} follows and the decisions it makes to choose a good join order, (ii) showing {ROX’s} robustness in the face of data with different degree of correlation, (iii) comparing the performance of the plan chosen by {ROX} to different plans picked from the search space, (iv) proving that the run-time overhead needed by {ROX} is restricted to a small fraction of the execution time.},

	abstract = {Abstract  Efficient management of {RDF} data is an important prerequisite for realizing the Semantic Web vision. Performance and scalability
issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper,
we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for {RDF} data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability
limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance of {RDF} databases and consider a
recent suggestion, “property tables”. We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features.
As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the {RDF} data. We compare the performance of
vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based {RDF} browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million
triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertically partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the
property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented {DBMS} (a database architected specially
for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented {DBMS,} another order of magnitude performance improvement
is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds. Encouraged by these results, we describe the architecture
of {SW-Store,} a new {DBMS} we are actively building that implements these techniques to achieve high performance {RDF} data management.},

have limitations on both their failure tolerance and scalability. Therefore, {RDF} query processing in a {P2P} environment is

merely for triple retrieval rather than for triple join query processing. Consequently, they suffer from an unnecessary data
transfer problem. This paper presents an {RDF} query processing technique based on a three-dimensional hash index. The triples
are mapped into the index; then bit information that represents the presence or absence of triples in the index is introduced.
We implemented our approach on the top of an emulated {P2P} environment. Evaluation results show that our approach can achieve

queries over the Web of Linked Data. The main idea of our approach is to discover data that might be relevant for answering
a query during the query execution itself. This discovery is driven by following {RDF} links between data sources based on {URIs}
in the query and in partial results. The {URIs} are resolved over the {HTTP} protocol into {RDF} data which is continuously added
to the queried dataset. This paper describes concepts and algorithms to implement our approach using an iterator-based pipeline.
We introduce a formalization of the pipelining approach and show that classical iterators may cause blocking due to the latency
of {HTTP} requests. To avoid blocking, we propose an extension of the iterator paradigm. The evaluation of our approach shows
its strengths as well as the still existing challenges.},

	abstract = {We study the problem of query optimization in federated relational
database systems. The nature of federated databases explicitly decouples
many aspects of the optimization process, often making it imperative for
the optimizer to consult underlying data sources while doing cost-based
optimization. This not only increases the cost of optimization, but also
changes the trade-offs involved in the optimization process
significantly. The dominant cost in the decoupled optimization process
is the "cost of costing" that traditionally has been considered
insignificant. The optimizer can only afford a few rounds of messages to
the underlying data sources and hence the optimization techniques in
this environment must be geared toward gathering all the required cost
information with minimal communication. In this paper, we explore the
design space for a query optimizer in this environment and demonstrate
the need for decoupling various aspects of the optimization process. We
present minimum-communication decoupled variants of various query
optimization techniques, and discuss tradeoffs in their performance in
this scenario. We have implemented these techniques in the Cohera
federated database system and our experimental results, somewhat
surprisingly, indicate that a simple two-phase optimization scheme
performs fairly well as long as the physical database design is known to
the optimizer, though more aggressive algorithms are required otherwise},

Since these requirements pose a problem to lay or occasional users, several methods incorporate keyword search {(KS)} into relational databases. However, most of the existing techniques focus on querying a single {DBMS.} On the other hand, the proliferation of distributed databases in several conventional and emerging applications necessitates the support for keyword-based data sharing and querying over multiple {DMBSs.} In order to avoid the high cost of searching in numerous, potentially irrelevant, databases in such systems, we propose {G-KS,} a novel method for selecting the {top-K} candidates based on their potential to contain results for a given query. {G-KSsummarizes} each database by a keyword relationship graph, where nodes represent terms and edges describe relationships between them. Keyword relationship graphs are utilized for computing the similarity between each database and a {KS} query, so that, during query processing, only the most promising databases are searched. An extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that {G-KS} outperforms the current state-of-the-art technique on all aspects, including precision, recall, efficiency, space overhead and flexibility of accommodating different semantics.},

In this paper we present techniques for joint optimization of cost and coverage of the query plans. Our algorithms search in the space of parallel query plans that support multiple sources for each subgoal conjunct. The refinement of the partial plans takes into account the potential parallelism between source calls, and the binding compatibilities between the sources included in the plan. We start by introducing and motivating our query plan representation. We then briefly review how to compute the cost and coverage of a parallel plan. Next, we provide both a {System-R} style query optimization algorithm as well as a greedy local search algorithm for searching in the space of such query plans. Finally we present a simulation study that demonstrates that the plans generated by our approach will be significantly better, both in terms of planning cost, and in terms of plan execution cost, compared to the existing approaches.},

include transportation network, Internet traffic analyzing, Web navigation, semantic web, chemical informatics and bio-informatics
systems, and computer vision. A graph reachability query, as one of the primary tasks, is to find whether two given data objects,
u and v, are related in any ways in a large and complex dataset. Formally, the query is about to find if v is reachable from u in a directed graph which is large in size. In this paper, we focus ourselves on building a reachability labeling for a large
directed graph, in order to process reachability queries efficiently. Such a labeling needs to be minimized in size for the
efficiency of answering the queries, and needs to be computed fast for the efficiency of constructing such a labeling. As
such a labeling, 2-hop cover was proposed for arbitrary graphs with theoretical bounds on both the construction cost and the
size of the resulting labeling. However, in practice, as reported, the construction cost of 2-hop cover is very high even
with super power machines. In this paper, we propose a novel geometry-based algorithm which computes high-quality 2-hop cover
fast. Our experimental results verify the effectiveness of our techniques over large real and synthetic graph datasets.},

However, it is challenging to compute a 2-hop cover. The existing approaches suffer from either large resource consumption or low compression rate. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical partitioning approach to partition a large graph G into two subgraphs repeatedly in a top-down fashion. The unique feature of our approach is that we compute 2-hop cover while partitioning. In brief, in every iteration of top-down partitioning, we provide techniques to compute the 2-hop cover for connections between the two subgraphs first. A cover is computed to cut the graph into two subgraphs, which results in an overall cover with high compression for the entire graph G. Two approaches are proposed, namely a node-oriented approach and an edge-oriented approach. Our approach can efficiently compute 2-hop cover for a large graph with high compression rate. Our extensive experiment studies show that the 2-hop cover for a graph with 1,700,000 nodes and 169 billion connections can be obtained in less than 30 minutes with a compression rate about 40,000 using a {PC.}},

Many studies have discovered patterns in static graphs, identifying properties in a single snapshot of a large network, or in a very small number of snapshots; these include heavy tails for in- and out-degree distributions, communities, small-world phenomena, and others. However, given the lack of information about network evolution over long periods, it has been hard to convert these findings into statements about trends over {time.Here} we study a wide range of real graphs, and we observe some surprising phenomena. First, most of these graphs densify over time, with the number of edges growing super-linearly in the number of nodes. Second, the average distance between nodes often shrinks over time, in contrast to the conventional wisdom that such distance parameters should increase slowly as a function of the number of nodes (like O(log n) or O(log(log {n)).Existing} graph generation models do not exhibit these types of behavior, even at a qualitative level. We provide a new graph generator, based on a "forest fire" spreading process, that has a simple, intuitive justification, requires very few parameters (like the "flammability" of nodes), and produces graphs exhibiting the full range of properties observed both in prior work and in the present study.},

A desirable property for such operators is instance-optimality, i.e., their {I/O} cost should remain within a factor of the optimal for different inputs. However, a recent theoretical study has shown that existing rank join operators are not instance-optimal even though they have been shown to perform well empirically. The same study proposed the {PBRJRRoverFR} operator that was proved to be instance-optimal, but its performance was not tested empirically and in fact it was hinted that its complexity can be high. Thus, the following important question is raised: Is it possible to design a rank join operator that is both instance-optimal and computationally efficient?},

Current join algorithms either minimize the execution time at the expense of response time or minimize response time by producing results early without optimizing the total time. We present a hash-based join algorithm, called early hash join, which can be dynamically configured at any point during join processing to tradeoff faster production of results for overall execution time. We demonstrate that varying how inputs are read has a major effect on these two factors and provide formulas that allow an optimizer to calculate the expected rate of join output and the number of {I/O} operations performed using different input reading strategies. Experimental results show that early hash join performs significantly fewer {I/O} operations and executes faster than other early join algorithms, especially for one-to-many joins. Its overall execution time is comparable to standard hybrid hash join, but its response time is an order of magnitude faster. Thus, early hash join can replace hybrid hash join in any situation where a fast initial response time is beneficial without the penalty in overall execution time exhibited by other early join algorithms.},

The demands for efficient access and management of large relationships motivate the need for explicitly storing the transitive closure in a compressed and local way, while allowing updates to the base relation to be propagated incrementally. We present a transitive closure compression technique, based on labeling spanning trees with numeric intervals, and provide both analytical and empirical evidence of its efficacy, including a proof of optimality.},

	abstract = {Reachability queries on large directed graphs have attracted much attention recently. The existing work either uses spanning structures, such as chains or trees, to compress the complete transitive closure, or utilizes the 2-hop strategy to describe the reachability. Almost all of these approaches work well for very sparse graphs. However, the challenging problem is that as the ratio of the number of edges to the number of vertices increases, the size of the compressed transitive closure grows very large. In this paper, we propose a new 3-hop indexing scheme for directed graphs with higher density. The basic idea of 3-hop indexing is to use chain structures in combination with hops to minimize the number of structures that must be indexed. Technically, our goal is to find a 3-hop scheme over dense {DAGs} (directed acyclic graphs) with minimum index size. We develop an efficient algorithm to discover a transitive closure contour, which yields near optimal index size. Empirical studies show that our 3-hop scheme has much smaller index size than state-of-the-art reachability query schemes such as 2-hop and path-tree when {DAGs} are not very sparse, while our query time is close to path-tree, which is considered to be one of the best reachability query schemes.},

Optimized query plans push the evaluation of powerful data-reducing operators to the data source sites while executing data-inflating operators near the client's site. The Volume Reduction Factor is a new and more explicit metric introduced in this paper to select the best site to execute query operators and is shown to be more accurate than the standard selectivity factor alone. {MOCHA} has been implemented in Java and runs on top of Informix and Oracle. We present the architecture of {MOCHA,} the ideas behind it, and a performance study using scientific data and queries. The results of this study demonstrate that {MOCHA} provides a more flexible, scalable and efficient framework for distributed query processing compared to those in existing middleware solutions.},

Both have two severe limitations: They handle only (1) simple (binary) join predicates and (2) inner joins. However, real queries may contain complex join predicates, involving more than two relations, and outer joins as well as other non-inner joins. Taking the most efficient known join-ordering algorithm, {DPccp,} as a starting point, we first develop a new algorithm, {DPhyp,} which is capable to handle complex join predicates efficiently. We do so by modeling the query graph as a (variant of a) hypergraph and then reason about its connected subgraphs. Then, we present a technique to exploit this capability to efficiently handle the widest class of non-inner joins dealt with so far. Our experimental results show that this reformulation of non-inner joins as complex predicates can improve optimization time by orders of magnitude, compared to known algorithms dealing with complex join predicates and non-inner joins. Once again, this gives dynamic programming a distinct advantage over current memoization techniques.},

of the most successful Semantic Web applications. In semantic wikis, wikis pages are annotated with semantic data to facilitate

the common understanding of the community. However, in a collaborative knowledge building process the knowledge is basically
created by individuals who are involved in a social process. Therefore, it is fundamental to support personal knowledge building
in a differentiated way. Currently there are no available semantic wikis that support both personal and shared understandings.
In order to overcome this problem, we propose a {P2P} collaborative knowledge building process and extend semantic wikis with
personal annotations facilities to express personal understanding. In this paper, we detail the personal semantic annotation
model and show its implementation in {P2P} semantic wikis. We also detail an evaluation study which shows that personal annotations
demand less cognitive efforts than semantic data and are very useful to enrich the shared knowledge base.},

This problem is important for many applications such as distributed databases, data warehousing, and data integration. We explore the decidability and complexity of the problem for workloads of conjunctive queries. We show that results differ significantly depending on whether the workload queries have self-joins. If queries can have self-joins, then a disjunctive viewset can be a better solution than any set of conjunctive views. We show that the problem of finding a minimal-size disjunctive viewset is decidable, and give an upper bound on its complexity. If workload queries cannot have self-joins, there is no need to consider disjunctive viewsets, and we show that the problem is in {NP.} We describe a very compact search space of conjunctive views, which contains all views in at least one optimal disjunctive viewset. We give a dynamic-programming algorithm for finding minimal-size disjunctive viewsets for queries without self-joins, and discuss heuristics to make the algorithm efficient.},

Our main interest is in the minimal length of labels needed in different cases. We obtain upper and lower bounds for several interesting families of graphs. In particular, our main results are the following. For general graphs, we show that the length needed is {[Theta](n).} For trees, we show that the length needed is {[Theta](log2n).} For planar graphs, we show an upper bound of and a lower bound of {[Omega](n1/3).} For bounded degree graphs, we show a lower bound of .
The upper bounds for planar graphs and for trees follow by a more general upper bound for graphs with a r(n)-separator. The two lower bounds, however, are obtained by two different arguments that may be interesting in their own right.
We also show some lower bounds on the length of the labels, even if it is only required that distances be approximated to a multiplicative factor s. For example, we show that for general graphs the required length is {[Omega](n)} for every s{\textless}3. We also consider the problem of the time complexity of the distance function once the labels are computed. We show that there are graphs with optimal labels of length 3logn, such that if we use any labels with fewer than n bits per label, computing the distance function requires exponential time. A similar result is obtained for planar and bounded degree graphs.},

Our main result is an algorithm for arranging a query's web service calls into a pipelined execution plan that optimally exploits parallelism among web services to minimize the query's total running time. Surprisingly, the optimal plan can be found in polynomial time even in the presence of arbitrary precedence constraints among web services, in contrast to traditional query optimization where the analogous problem is {NP-hard.} We also give an algorithm for determining the optimal granularity of data "chunks" to be used for each web service call.

Therefore, an important problem to be addressed is the automatic extraction of query interfaces into an appropriate model. We hypothesize the existence of a set of domain-independent "commonsense design rules" that guides the creation of Web query interfaces. These rules transform query interfaces into schema trees. In this paper we describe a Web query interface extraction algorithm, which combines {HTML} tokens and the geometric layout of these tokens within a Web page. Tokens are classified into several classes out of which the most significant ones are text tokens and field tokens. A tree structure is derived for text tokens using their geometric layout. Another tree structure is derived for the field tokens. The hierarchical representation of a query interface is obtained by iteratively merging these two trees. Thus, we convert the extraction problem into an integration problem. Our experiments show the promise of our algorithm: it outperforms the previous approaches on extracting query interfaces on about 6.5\% in accuracy as evaluated over three corpora with more than 500 Deep Web interfaces from 15 different domains.},

Performance and scalability issues are becoming increasingly pressing as Semantic Web technology is applied to real-world applications. In this paper, we examine the reasons why current data management solutions for {RDF} data scale poorly, and explore the fundamental scalability limitations of these approaches. We review the state of the art for improving performance for {RDF} databases and consider a recent suggestion, "property tables." We then discuss practically and empirically why this solution has undesirable features. As an improvement, we propose an alternative solution: vertically partitioning the {RDF} data. We compare the performance of vertical partitioning with prior art on queries generated by a Web-based {RDF} browser over a large-scale (more than 50 million triples) catalog of library data. Our results show that a vertical partitioned schema achieves similar performance to the property table technique while being much simpler to design. Further, if a column-oriented {DBMS} (a database architected specially for the vertically partitioned case) is used instead of a row-oriented {DBMS,} another order of magnitude performance improvement is observed, with query times dropping from minutes to several seconds.},

	abstract = {{RDF} is a data representation format for schema-free structured information that is gaining momentum in the context of {Semantic-Web} corpora, life sciences, and also Web 2.0 platforms. The "pay-as-you-go" nature of {RDF} and the flexible pattern-matching capabilities of its query language {SPARQL} entail efficiency and scalability challenges for complex queries including long join paths. This paper presents the {RDF-3X} engine, an implementation of {SPARQL} that achieves excellent performance by pursuing a {RISC-style} architecture with a streamlined architecture and carefully designed, puristic data structures and operations. The salient points of {RDF-3X} are: 1) a generic solution for storing and indexing {RDF} triples that completely eliminates the need for physical-design tuning, 2) a powerful yet simple query processor that leverages fast merge joins to the largest possible extent, and 3) a query optimizer for choosing optimal join orders using a cost model based on statistical synopses for entire join paths. The performance of {RDF-3X,} in comparison to the previously best state-of-the-art systems, has been measured on several large-scale datasets with more than 50 million {RDF} triples and benchmark queries that include pattern matching and long join paths in the underlying data graphs.},

For a large graph, there is the new scenario to query intensively against arbitrary nodes, asking to quickly return node distance or even shortest paths. And traditional main memory algorithms and shortest paths materialization become inadequate. We are interested in graph labelings to encode the underlying graphs and assign labels to nodes to support efficient query processing. Surprisingly, the existing work of this category mainly emphasizes on reachability query processing, while no sufficient effort has been given to distance labelings to support querying exact shortest distances between nodes. Distance labelings must be developed on the graph in whole to correctly retain node distance information. It makes many existing methods to be inapplicable. We focus on fast computing distance-aware 2-hop covers, which can encode the all-pairs shortest paths of a graph in {O({\textbar}V{\textbar}·{\textbar}E{\textbar}1/2)} space. Our approach exploits strongly connected components collapsing and graph partitioning to gain speed, while it can overcome the challenges in correctly retaining node distance information and appropriately encoding all-pairs shortest paths with small overhead. Furthermore, our approach avoids pre-computing all-pairs shortest paths, which can be prohibitive over large graphs. We conducted extensive performance studies, and confirm the efficiency of our proposed new approaches.},

Understanding the database schema, the hidden relationships among attributes in the data all play an important role in this context. Subscribing to this viewpoint, in this paper, we present a novel data-driven approach, called Query By Output {(QBO),} which can enhance the usability of database systems. The central goal of {QBO} is as follows: given the output of some query Q on a database D, denoted by {Q(D),} we wish to construct an alternative query Q′ such that {Q(D)} and Q′ {(D)} are instance-equivalent. To generate instance-equivalent queries from {Q(D),} we devise a novel data classification-based technique that can handle the at-least-one semantics that is inherent in the query derivation. In addition to the basic framework, we design several optimization techniques to reduce processing overhead and introduce a set of criteria to rank order output queries by various notions of utility. Our framework is evaluated comprehensively on three real data sets and the results show that the instance-equivalent queries we obtain are interesting and that the approach is scalable and robust to queries of different selectivities.},

However, for many applications it is desirable to have a unified view on this knowledge, allowing to reason about it and to query it without regarding the heterogeneity of the underlying systems. In this context, two main requirements have to be fulfilled. On the one hand, a retrieval system has to be semantically rich, in order to be able to cope with and mediate between different schemas, and on the other hand it has to be scalable to large numbers of information sources. The dynamic nature of information makes the problem even {worse.Within} this paper, we propose a solution to this problem. We describe a {DHT-based} peer-2-peer network storing knowledge in the form of {RDF} triples. The query evaluation algorithm allows to use arbitrary query patterns, and evaluates the query with respect to taxonomical reasoning. Thus the system combines expressivity and scalability. Although we describe the whole system, the focus of this paper is the query {evaluation.The} system is generic by nature and suitable for numerous different applications. We describe an example application stemming from the Semantic Grid.},

In this paper, we propose a novel graph clustering algorithm, {SA-Cluster,} based on both structural and attribute similarities through a unified distance measure. Our method partitions a large graph associated with attributes into k clusters so that each cluster contains a densely connected subgraph with homogeneous attribute values. An effective method is proposed to automatically learn the degree of contributions of structural similarity and attribute similarity. Theoretical analysis is provided to show that {SA-Cluster} is converging. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of {SA-Cluster} through comparison with the state-of-the-art graph clustering and summarization methods.},

	abstract = {Graph reachability is fundamental to a wide range of applications, including {XML} indexing, geographic navigation, Internet routing, ontology queries based on {RDF/OWL,} etc. Many applications involve huge graphs and require fast answering of reachability queries. Several reachability labeling methods have been proposed for this purpose. They assign labels to the vertices, such that the reachability between any two vertices may be decided using their labels only. For sparse graphs, 2-hop based reachability labeling schemes answer reachability queries efficiently using relatively small label space. However, the labeling process itself is often too time consuming to be practical for large graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel labeling scheme for sparse graphs. Our scheme ensures that graph reachability queries can be answered in constant time. Furthermore, for sparse graphs, the complexity of the labeling process is almost linear, which makes our algorithm applicable to massive datasets. Analytical and experimental results show that our approach is much more efficient than stateof- the-art approaches. Furthermore, our labeling method also provides an alternative scheme to tradeoff query time for label space, which further benefits applications that use tree-like graphs.},

The deeper, underlying question is subtle: how do we measure {success?.We} answer the above questions, and test our answers by thorough experiments on several, diverse datasets, spanning thousands nodes and edges. We consider several sampling methods, propose novel methods to check the goodness of sampling, and develop a set of scaling laws that describe relations between the properties of the original and the {sample.In} addition to the theoretical contributions, the practical conclusions from our work are: Sampling strategies based on edge selection do not perform well; simple uniform random node selection performs surprisingly well. Overall, best performing methods are the ones based on random-walks and "forest fire"; they match very accurately both static as well as evolutionary graph patterns, with sample sizes down to about 15\% of the original graph.},

In a database system, such an operation is called a recursion computation or reachability checking and not efficiently supported. The reason for this is that the space to store the whole transitive closure of G is prohibitively high. In this paper, we address this issue and propose an 0(n2 + bnradic(b)) time algorithm to decompose a directed acyclic graph {(DAG)} into a minimized set of disjoint chains to facilitate reachability checking, where n is the number of the nodes and b is the {DAG's} width, defined to be the size of a largest node subset U of the {DAG} such that for every pair of nodes u, v isin U, there does not exist a path from u to v or from v to u. Using this algorithm, we are able to label a graph in 0(be) time and store all the labels in O(bn) space with O(logb) reachability checking time, where e is the number of the edges of the {DAG.} The method can also be extended to handle cyclic directed graphs.

Data streams are potentially infinite and the query result is expected to be generated incrementally instead of once only. Data arrival patterns are often unpredictable and the statistics of the data and other relevant metadata often are only known at runtime. In some cases they are supplied interleaved with the actual data in the form of stream markers. Recently, stream join algorithms, like Symmetric Hash Join and {XJoin,} have been designed to perform in a pipelined fashion to cope with the latent delivery of data. However, none of them to date takes metadata, especially runtime metadata, into consideration. Hence, the join execution logic defined statically before runtime may not be well suited to deal with varying types of dynamic runtime scenarios. Also the potentially unbounded state needs to be maintained by the join operator to guarantee the precision of the result. In this paper, we propose a metadata-aware stream join operator called {MJoin} which is able to exploit metadata to (1) detect and purge useless materialized data to save computation resources and (2) optimize the execution logic to target diferent optimization goals. We have implemented the {MJoin} operator. The experimental results validate our metadata-driven join optimization strategies.},

Some of these applications involve huge graphs and yet require fast query answering. We propose a new data structure for representing all distances in a graph. The data structure is distributed in the sense that it may be viewed as assigning labels to the vertices, such that a query involving vertices u and v may be answered using only the labels of u and {v.Our} labels are based on 2-hop covers of the shortest paths, or of all paths, in a graph. For shortest paths, such a cover is a collection S of shortest paths such that for every two vertices u and v, there is a shortest path from u to v that is a concatenation of two paths from S. We describe an efficient algorithm for finding an almost optimal 2-hop cover of a given collection of paths. Our approach is general and can be applied to directed or undirected graphs, exact or approximate shortest paths, or to reachability {queries.We} study the proposed data structure using a combination of theoretical and experimental means. We implemented our algorithm and checked the size of the resulting data structure on several real-life networks from different application areas. Our experiments show that the total size of the labels is typically not much larger than the network itself, and is usually considerably smaller than an explicit representation of the transitive closure of the network.},

Prior to the current work, it was also unknown whether these fixed-step estimation procedures can be extended to asymptotically efficient fixed-precision estimation procedures. Our second main result is a general method for such an extension and a proof that the method is valid for all the estimation procedures under consideration. Finally, we show that, under reasonable assumptions on sampling costs, the partial ordering on the variability of the fixed-step estimation procedures implies a partial ordering on the cost of the corresponding fixed-precision estimation procedures. These results lead to a new algorithm for fixed-precision estimation of the selectivity of an equijoin. The algorithm appears to be the best available when there are no indices on the join key.

	abstract = {This paper presents a principled framework for efficient processing of ad-hoc top-k (ranking) aggregate queries, which provide the k groups with the highest aggregates as results. Essential support of such queries is lacking in current systems, which process the queries in a naïve materialize-group-sort scheme that can be prohibitively inefficient. Our framework is based on three fundamental principles. The {Upper-Bound} Principle dictates the requirements of early pruning, and the {Group-Ranking} and {Tuple-Ranking} Principles dictate group-ordering and tuple-ordering requirements. They together guide the query processor toward a provably optimal tuple schedule for aggregate query processing. We propose a new execution framework to apply the principles and requirements. We address the challenges in realizing the framework and implementing new query operators, enabling efficient group-aware and rank-aware query plans. The experimental study validates our framework by demonstrating orders of magnitude performance improvement in the new query plans, compared with the traditional plans.},

	abstract = {In many modern data management settings, data is queried from a central node or nodes, but is stored at remote sources. In such a setting it is common to perform "push-style" query processing, using multithreaded pipelined hash joins and bushy query plans to compute parts of the query in parallel; to avoid idling, the {CPU} can switch between them as delays are encountered. This works well for simple select-project-join queries, but increasingly, Web and integration applications require more complex queries with multiple joins and even nested subqueries. As we demonstrate in this paper, push-style execution of complex queries can be improved substantially via sideways information passing; push-style queries provide many opportunities for information passing that have not been studied in the past literature. We present adaptive information passing, a general runtime decision-making technique for reusing intermediate state from one query subresult to prune and reduce computation of other subresults. We develop two alternative schemes for performing adaptive information passing, which we study in several settings under a variety of workloads.},

the macroscopic properties of object links are helpful for better understanding the current Data Web. In this paper, we propose
a notion of object link graph {(OLG)} in the Semantic Web, and analyze the complex network structure of an {OLG} constructed from
the latest dataset {(FC09)} collected by the Falcons search engine. We find that the {OLG} has the scale-free nature and the approximate
effective diameter of the graph is small compared to its scale, which are also consistent with the experimental result based
on our last year’s dataset {(FC08).} The amount of {RDF} documents and objects by Falcons both doubled during the past year, but
the object link graph remains the same density while the diameter is getting shrinking. We also repeat the complex network
analysis on the two largest domain-specific subsets of {FC09,} namely {Bio2RDF(FC09)} and {DBpedia(FC09).} The results show that
both {Bio2RDF(FC09)} and {DBpedia(FC09)} have low density in object links, which contribute to the low density of object links

The need for self-* properties is more evident in distributed applications comprising heterogeneous and autonomous databases and functionality providers. Such resources are typically exposed as Web Services {(WSs),} which encapsulate remote {DBMSs} and functions called from within database queries. In this setting, database queries are over {WSs,} and the data transfer cost becomes the main bottleneck. To reduce this cost, data is shipped to and from {WSs} in chunks; however the optimum chunk size is volatile, depending on both the resources' runtime properties and the query. In this paper we propose a robust control theoretical solution to the problem of optimizing the data transfer in queries over {WSs,} by continuously tuning at runtime the block size and thus tracking the optimum point. Also, we develop online system identification mechanisms that are capable of estimating the optimum block size analytically. Both contributions are evaluated via both empirical experimentation in a real environment and simulations, and have been proved to be more effective and efficient than static solutions.},

	abstract = {Shortest path queries {(SPQ)} are essential in many graph analysis and mining tasks. However, answering shortest path queries on-the-fly on large graphs is costly. To online answer shortest path queries, we may materialize and index shortest paths. However, a straightforward index of all shortest paths in a graph of N vertices takes {O(N2)} space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of indexing shortest paths and online answering shortest path queries. As many large real graphs are shown richly symmetric, the central idea of our approach is to use graph symmetry to reduce the index size while retaining the correctness and the efficiency of shortest path query answering. Technically, we develop a framework to index a large graph at the orbit level instead of the vertex level so that the number of breadth-first search trees materialized is reduced from {O(N)} to O({\textbar}Δ{\textbar}), where {\textbar}Δ{\textbar} ≤ N is the number of orbits in the graph. We explore orbit adjacency and local symmetry to obtain compact breadth-first-search trees (compact {BFS-trees).} An extensive empirical study using both synthetic data and real data shows that compact {BFS-trees} can be built efficiently and the space cost can be reduced substantially. Moreover, online shortest path query answering can be achieved using compact {BFS-trees.}},

	abstract = {In many applications, the underlying data (the web, an {XML} document, or a relational database) can be seen as a graph. These graphs may be enriched with weights, associated with the nodes and edges of the graph, denoting application specific desirability/penalty assessments, such as popularity, trust, or cost. A particular challenge when considering such weights in query processing is that results need to be ranked accordingly. Answering keyword-based queries on weighted graphs is shown to be computationally expensive. In this paper, we first show that answering queries with further structure imposed on them remains {NP-hard.} We next show that, while the query evaluation task can be viewed in terms of ranked structural-joins along query axes, the monotonicity property, necessary for ranked join algorithms, is violated. Consequently, traditional ranked join algorithms are not directly applicable. Thus, we establish an alternative, sum-max monotonicity property and show how to leverage this for developing a self-punctuating, horizon-based ranked join {(HR-Join)} operator for ranked twig-query execution on data graphs. We experimentally show the effectiveness of the proposed evaluation schemes and the {HR-join} operator for merging ranked sub-results under sum-max monotonicity.},

However, this time-consuming pre-processing phase however leverages the benefits of Linked Data -- where structured data is accessible live and up-to-date at distributed Web resources that may change constantly -- only to a limited degree, as query results can never be current. An ideal query answering system for Linked Data should return current answers in a reasonable amount of time, even on corpora as large as the Web. Query processors evaluating queries directly on the live sources require knowledge of the contents of data sources. In this paper, we develop and evaluate an approximate index structure summarising graph-structured content of sources adhering to Linked Data principles, provide an algorithm for answering conjunctive queries over Linked Data on {theWeb} exploiting the source summary, and evaluate the system using synthetically generated queries. The experimental results show that our lightweight index structure enables complete and up-to-date query results over Linked Data, while keeping the overhead for querying low and providing a satisfying source ranking at no additional cost.},

As a user-friendly method for querying this complex, ever-expanding network of sources for correlations, we propose exploratory queries. Exploratory queries are loosely-structured, hence requiring only minimal user knowledge of the source network. Evaluating an exploratory query usually involves the evaluation of many distributed queries. As the number of such distributed queries can quickly become large, we attack the optimization problem for exploratory queries by proposing several multi-query optimization algorithms that compute a global evaluation plan while minimizing the total communication cost, a key bottleneck in distributed settings. The proposed algorithms are necessarily heuristics, as computing an optimal global evaluation plan is shown to be {NP-hard.} Finally, we present an implementation of our algorithms, along with experiments that illustrate their potential not only for the optimization of exploratory queries, but also for the multiquery optimization of large batches of standard queries.},

The {HMJ} algorithm has two phases: The hashing phase and the merging phase. The hashing phase employs an in-memory hash-based join algorithm that produces join results as quickly as data arrives. The merging phase is responsible for producing join results if the two sources are blocked. Both phases of the {HMJ} algorithm are connected via a flushing policy that flushes in-memory parts into disk storage once the memory is exhausted.

Recently, answering keyword queries on graph-structured data has emerged as an important research topic. The prevalent approaches build on dedicated indexing techniques as well as search algorithms aiming at finding substructures that connect the data elements matching the keywords. In this paper, we introduce a novel keyword search paradigm for graph-structured data, focusing in particular on the {RDF} data model. Instead of computing answers directly as in previous approaches, we first compute queries from the keywords, allowing the user to choose the appropriate query, and finally, process the query using the underlying database engine. Thereby, the full range of database optimization techniques can be leveraged for query processing. For the computation of queries, we propose a novel algorithm for the exploration of top-k matching subgraphs. While related techniques search the best answer trees, our algorithm is guaranteed to compute all k subgraphs with lowest costs, including cyclic graphs. By performing exploration only on a summary data structure derived from the data graph, we achieve promising performance improvements compared to other approaches.},

In this paper we identify and address a fundamental limitation of the original eddies proposal: the burden of history in routing. We observe that routing decisions have long-term effects on the state of operators in the query, and can severely constrain the ability of the eddy to adapt over time. We then propose a mechanism we call {STAIRs} that allows the query engine to manipulate the state stored inside the operators and undo the effects of past routing decisions. We demonstrate that eddies with {STAIRs} achieve both high adaptivity and good performance in the face of uncertainty, outperforming prior eddy proposals by orders of magnitude.},

Prior to the current work, it was also unknown whether these fixed-step procedures could be extended to fixed-precision procedures that are both asymptotically consistent and asymptotically efficient. Our second main result is a general method for such an extension and a proof that the method is valid for all the procedures under consideration. We show that, under plausible assumptions on sampling costs, the partial ordering of the fixed-step procedures with respect to variability of the selectivity estimator implies a partial ordering of the corresponding fixed-precision procedures with respect to sampling cost. Our final result is a collection of fixed-step and fixed-precision procedures for estimating the cost of processing a join query according to a fixed join plan.},

An algorithm for enumerating answers is presented within an architecture that has two main components: an engine that generates a set of candidate answers and a ranker that evaluates their score. To be effective, the engine must have three fundamental properties. It should not miss relevant answers, has to be efficient and must generate the answers in an order that is highly correlated with the desired ranking. It is shown that none of the existing systems has implemented an engine that has all of these properties. In contrast, this paper presents an engine that generates all the answers with provable guarantees. Experiments show that the engine performs well in practice. It is also shown how to adapt this engine to queries under the {OR} semantics. In addition, this paper presents a novel approach for implementing rankers destined for eliminating redundancy. Essentially, an answer is ranked according to its individual properties (relevancy) and its intersection with the answers that have already been presented to the user. Within this approach, experiments with specific rankers are described.},

However, most of the current research work focuses on keyword-based searching over a single structured data source. With the growing interest in distributed databases and service oriented architecture over the Internet, it is important to extend such a capability over multiple structured data sources. One of the most important problems for enabling such a query facility is to be able to select the most useful data sources relevant to the keyword query. Traditional database summary techniques used for selecting unstructured datasources developed in {IR} literature are inadequate for our problem, as they do not capture the structure of the data sources. In this paper, we study the database selection problem for relational data sources, and propose a method that effectively summarizes the relationships between keywords in a relational database based on its structure. We develop effective ranking methods based on the keyword relationship summaries in order to select the most useful databases for a given keyword query. We have implemented our system on {PlanetLab.} In that environment we use extensive experiments with real datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed summarization method.},

In this paper we propose double index nested loops reactive join {(DINER),} a new adaptive join algorithm for result rate maximization. {DINER} combines two key elements: an intuitive flushing policy that aims to increase the productivity of in-memory tuples in producing results during the online phase of the join, and a novel re-entrant join technique that allows the algorithm to rapidly switch between processing in-memory and disk-resident tuples, thus better exploiting temporary delays when new data is not available. Our experiments using real and synthetic data sets demonstrate that {DINER} outperforms previous adaptive join algorithms in producing result tuples at a significantly higher rate, while making better use of the available memory.},

	abstract = {Graph-structured databases and related problems such as reachability query processing have been increasingly relevant to many
applications such as {XML} databases, biological databases, social network analysis and the Semantic Web. To efficiently evaluate
reachability queries on large graph-structured databases, there has been a host of recent research on graph indexing. To date,
reachability indexes are generally applied to the entire graph. This can often be suboptimal if the graph is large or/and
its subgraphs are diverse in structure. In this paper, we propose a uniform framework to support existing reachability indexing
for subgraphs of a given graph. This in turn supports fast reachability query processing in large graph-structured databases.
The contributions of our uniform framework are as follows: (1) We formally define a graph framework that facilitates indexing
subgraphs, as opposed to the entire graph. (2) We propose a heuristic algorithm to partition a given graph into subgraphs
for indexing. (3) We demonstrate how reachability queries are evaluated in the graph framework. Our preliminary experimental
results showed that the framework yields a smaller total index size and is more efficient in processing reachability queries
on large graphs than a fixed index scheme on the entire graphs.},

To address these problems, we propose {TEDI,} an indexing and query processing scheme for the shortest path query answering. {TEDI} is based on the tree decomposition methodology. The graph is first decomposed into a tree in which the node (a.k.a. bag) contains more than one vertex from the graph. The shortest paths are stored in such bags and these local paths together with the tree are the components of the index of the graph. Based on this index, a bottom-up operation can be executed to find the shortest path for any given source and target vertices. Our experimental results show that {TEDI} offers orders-of-magnitude performance improvement over existing approaches on the index construction time, the index size and the query answering.},

In this paper, we present a generalized architecture for adaptive query processing and introduce a new technique, called adaptive data partitioning {(ADP),} which is based on the idea of dividing the source data into regions, each executed by different, complementary plans. We show how this model can be applied in novel ways to not only correct for underestimated selectivity and cardinality values, but also to discover and exploit order in the source data, and to detect and exploit source data that can be effectively pre-aggregated.

	abstract = {Dynamic plan migration is concerned with the on-the-fly transition from one continuous query plan to a semantically equivalent yet more efficient plan. Migration is important for stream monitoring systems where long-running queries may have to withstand fluctuations in stream workloads and data characteristics. Existing migration methods generally adopt a pause-drain-resume strategy that pauses the processing of new data, purges all old data in the existing plan, until finally the new plan can be plugged into the system. However, these existing strategies do not address the problem of migrating query plans that contain stateful operators, such as joins. We now develop solutions for online plan migration for continuous stateful plans. In particular, in this paper, we propose two alternative strategies, called the moving state strategy and the parallel track strategy, one exploiting reusability and the second employs parallelism to seamlessly migrate between continuous join plans without affecting the results of the query. We develop cost models for both migration strategies to analytically compare them. We embed these migration strategies into the {CAPE} [7], a prototype system of a stream query engine, and conduct a comparative experimental study to evaluate these two strategies for window-based join plans. Our experimental results illustrate that the two strategies can vary significantly in terms of output rates and intermediate storage spaces given distinct system configurations and stream workloads.},

Our query class captures windowed join queries in data stream systems as well as conventional maintenance of materialized join views. Our adaptive approach handles streams of updates whose rates and data characteristics may change over time, as well as changes in system conditions such as memory availability. In this paper we focus specifically on the problem of adaptive placement and removal of caches to optimize join performance. Our approach automatically considers conventional tree-shaped join plans with materialized subresults at every intermediate node, subresult-free {MJoins,} and the entire spectrum between them. We provide algorithms for selecting caches, monitoring their cost and benefits in current conditions, allocating memory to caches, and adapting as conditions change. All of our algorithms are implemented in the {STREAM} prototype Data Stream Management System and a thorough experimental evaluation is included.},

In such scenarios it can be more efficient to process different subsets of the data for a query using different plans. We propose a new query processing technique called content-based routing {(CBR)} that eliminates the single-plan restriction in current systems. We present low-overhead adaptive algorithms that partition input data based on statistical properties relevant to query execution strategies, and efficiently route individual tuples through customized plans based on their partition. We have implemented {CBR} as an extension to the Eddies query processor in the {TelegraphCQ} system, and we present an extensive experimental evaluation showing the significant performance benefits of {CBR.}},

	abstract = {Join is an important database operation. As computer architectures evolve, the best join algorithm may change hand. This paper re-examines two popular join algorithms -- hash join and sort-merge join -- to determine if the latest computer architecture trends shift the tide that has favored hash join for many years. For a fair comparison, we implemented the most optimized parallel version of both algorithms on the latest Intel Core i7 platform. Both implementations scale well with the number of cores in the system and take advantages of latest processor features for performance. Our hash-based implementation achieves more than {100M} tuples per second which is {17X} faster than the best reported performance on {CPUs} and {8X} faster than that reported for {GPUs.} Moreover, the performance of our hash join implementation is consistent over a wide range of input data sizes from {64K} to {128M} tuples and is not affected by data skew. We compare this implementation to our highly optimized sort-based implementation that achieves {47M} to {80M} tuples per second. We developed analytical models to study how both algorithms would scale with upcoming processor architecture trends. Our analysis projects that current architectural trends of wider {SIMD,} more cores, and smaller memory bandwidth per core imply better scalability potential for sort-merge join. Consequently, sort-merge join is likely to outperform hash join on upcoming chip multiprocessors. In summary, we offer multicore implementations of hash join and sort-merge join which consistently outperform all previously reported results. We further conclude that the tide that favors the hash join algorithm has not changed yet, but the change is just around the corner.},

Existing {Peer-to-Peer} {(P2P)} {RDF} repositories either cannot guarantee to find query results, even if these results exist in the network, or require up-front definition of {RDF} schemas and designation of super peers. We present a scalable distributed {RDF} repository {(RDFPeers)} that stores each triple at three places in a multi-attribute addressable network by applying globally known hash functions to its subject predicate and object. Thus all nodes know which node is responsible for storing triple values they are looking for and both exact-match and range queries can be efficiently routed to those nodes. {RDFPeers} has no single point of failure nor elevated peers and does not require the prior definition of {RDF} schemas. Queries are guaranteed to find matched triples in the network if the triples exist. In {RDFPeers} both the number of neighbors per node and the number of routing hops for inserting {RDF} triples and for resolving most queries are logarithmic to the number of nodes in the network. We further performed experiments that show that the triple-storing load in {RDFPeers} differs by less than an order of magnitude between the most and the least loaded nodes for real-world {RDF} data.},

Breaking the encapsulation of joins serves two purposes. First, it allows the eddy to observe multiple physical operations embedded in a join algorithm, allowing for better calibration and control of these operations. Second, the {SteM} on a relation serves as a shared materialization point, enabling multiple competing access methods to share results, which can be leveraged by multiple competing join algorithms. Our architecture extends prior work significantly, allowing continuously adaptive decisions for most major aspects of traditional query optimization: choice of access methods and join algorithms, ordering of operators, and choice of a query spanning tree. {SteMs} introduce significant routing flexibility to the eddy, enabling more opportunities for adaptation, but also introducing the possibility of incorrect query results. We present constraints on eddy routing through {SteMs} that ensure correctness while preserving a great deal of flexibility. We also demonstrate the benefits of our architecture via experiments in the Telegraph dataflow system. We show that even a simple routing policy allows significant flexibility in adaptation, including novel effects like automatic "hybridization " of multiple algorithms for a single join.},

The problem has recently received significant attention because of its relevance to a wide variety of data management problems. In query optimization, finding a rewriting of a query using a set of materialized views can yield a more efficient query execution plan. To support the separation of the logical and physical views of data, a storage schema can be described using views over the logical schema. As a result, finding a query execution plan that accesses the storage amounts to solving the problem of answering queries using views. Finally, the problem arises in data integration systems, where data sources can be described as precomputed views over a mediated schema. This article surveys the state of the art on the problem of answering queries using views, and synthesizes the disparate works into a coherent framework. We describe the different applications of the problem, the algorithms proposed to solve it and the relevant theoretical results.},

Traditional offline join algorithms are designed to minimize the time to completion of the query. In contrast, ripple joins are designed to minimize the time until an acceptably precise estimate of the query result is available, as measured by the length of a confidence interval. Ripple joins are adaptive, adjusting their behavior during processing in accordance with the statistical properties of the data. Ripple joins also permit the user to dynamically trade off the two key performance factors of on-line aggregation: the time between successive updates of the running aggregate, and the amount by which the confidence-interval length decreases at each update. We show how ripple joins can be implemented in an existing {DBMS} using iterators, and we give an overview of the methods used to compute confidence intervals and to adaptively optimize the ripple join “aspect-ratio” parameters. In experiments with an initial implementation of our algorithms in the {POSTGRES} {DBMS,} the time required to produce reasonably precise online estimates was up to two orders of magnitude smaller than the time required for the best offline join algorithms to produce exact answers.},

We present an experimental comparison of existing storage strategies on top of the {SP2Bench} {SPARQL} performance benchmark suite and put the results into context by comparing them to a purely relational model of the benchmark scenario. We observe that (1) in terms of performance and scalability, a simple triple store built on top of a column-store {DBMS} is competitive to the vertically partitioned approach when choosing a physical (predicate, subject, object) sort order, (2) in our scenario with real-world queries, none of the approaches scales to documents containing tens of millions of {RDF} triples, and (3) none of the approaches can compete with a purely relational model.

	abstract = {Distributed data processing is becoming a reality. Businesses want to do it for many reasons, and they often must do it in order to stay competitive. While much of the infrastructure for distributed data processing is already there (e.g., modern network technology), a number of issues make distributed data processing still a complex undertaking: (1) distributed systems can become very large, involving thousands of heterogeneous sites including {PCs} and mainframe server machines; (2) the state of a distributed system changes rapidly because the load of sites varies over time and new sites are added to the system; (3) legacy systems need to be integrated—such legacy systems usually have not been designed for distributed data processing and now need to interact with other (modern) systems in a distributed environment. This paper presents the state of the art of query processing for distributed database and information systems. The paper presents the “textbook” architecture for distributed query processing and a series of techniques that are particularly useful for distributed database systems. These techniques include special join techniques, techniques to exploit intraquery paralleli sm, techniques to reduce communication costs, and techniques to exploit caching and replication of data. Furthermore, the paper discusses different kinds of distributed systems such as client-server, middleware (multitier), and heterogeneous database systems, and shows how query processing works in these systems.},

For instance, {PubMed} allows users to submit highly expressive Boolean keyword queries, but ranks the query results by date only. However, a user would typically prefer a ranking by relevance, measured by an Information Retrieval {(IR)} ranking function. The naive approach would be to submit a disjunctive query with all query keywords, retrieve the returned documents, and then re-rank them. Unfortunately, such an operation would be very expensive due to the large number of results returned by disjunctive queries. In this paper we present algorithms that return the top results for a query, ranked according to an {IR-style} ranking function, while operating on top of a source with a Boolean query interface with no ranking capabilities (or a ranking capability of no interest to the end user). The algorithms generate a series of conjunctive queries that return only documents that are candidates for being highly ranked according to a relevance metric. Our approach can also be applied to other settings where the ranking is monotonic on a set of factors (query keywords in {IR)} and the source query interface is a Boolean expression of these factors. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation on the {PubMed} database and {TREC} dataset show that we achieve order of magnitude improvement compared to the current baseline approaches.},

In this paper, we present and thoroughly evaluate a new class of query optimization algorithms that are based on a principle that we call iterative dynamic programming, or {IDP} for short. {IDP} has several important advantages: First, {IDP-algorithms} produce the best plans of all known algorithms in situations in which dynamic programming is not viable because of its high complexity. Second, some {IDP} variants are adaptive and produce as good plans as dynamic programming if dynamic programming is viable and as good-as possible plans if dynamic programming turns out to be not viable. Three, all {IDP-algorithms} can very easily be integrated into an existing optimizer which is based on dynamic programming.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a growing interest in join query evaluation for scenarios in which inputs arrive at highly variable and unpredictable rates. In such scenarios, the focus shifts from completing the computation as soon as possible to producing a prefix of the output as soon as possible. To handle this shift in focus, most solutions to date rely upon some combination of streaming binary operators and "on-the-fly" execution plan reorganization. In contrast, we consider the alternative of extending existing symmetric binary join operators to handle more than two inputs. Toward this end, we have completed a prototype implementation of a multi-way join operator, which we term the {"MJoin"} operator, and explored its performance. Our results show that in many instances the {MJoin} produces outputs sooner than any tree of binary operators. Additionally, since {MJoins} are completely symmetric with respect to their inputs, they can reduce the need for expensive runtime plan reorganization. This suggests that supporting multiway joins in a single, symmetric, streaming operator may be a useful addition to systems that support queries over input streams from remote sites.},

With the work in this paper we aim to endow peer-to-peer data management over structured overlays with the power associated
with such statistical information, with emphasis on meeting the scalability challenge. To this end, we first contribute efficient,
accurate, and decentralized algorithms that can compute key aggregates such as Count, {CountDistinct,} Sum, and Average. We
show how to construct several types of histograms, such as simple {Equi-Width,} {Average-Shifted} {Equi-Width,} and {Equi-Depth} histograms.
We present a full-fledged open-source implementation of these tools for distributed statistical synopses, and report on a
comprehensive experimental performance evaluation, evaluating our contributions in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.},

In this paper, we demonstrate Hermes, an infrastructure for data web search. To provide an end-user oriented interface, we support expressive keyword search by translating user information needs into structured queries. We integrate heterogeneous web data sources with automatically computed mappings. Schema-level mappings are exploited in constructing structured queries against the integrated schema. These structured queries are decomposed into queries against the local web data sources, which are then processed in a distributed way.},

Specifically, {R-KWS} explores a vast search space, comprised of all possible combinations of keyword occurrences in any attribute of every table. Existing systems follow two general methodologies for query processing: (i) graph based, which traverses a materialized data graph, and (ii) operator based, which executes relational operator trees on an underlying {DBMS.} In both cases, computations are largely wasted on graph traversals or operator tree executions that fail to return results. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a comprehensive framework for reachability indexing that eliminates such fruitless operations. We describe a range of indexes that capture various types of join reachability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed techniques significantly improve performance, often by several orders of magnitude.},

	abstract = {{XML} has become the lingua franca for data exchange and integration across administrative and enterprise boundaries. Nearly all data providers are adding {XML} import or export capabilities, and standard {XML} Schemas and {DTDs} are being promoted for all types of data sharing. The ubiquity of {XML} has removed one of the major obstacles to integrating data from widely disparate sources - namely, the heterogeneity of data formats. However, general-purpose integration of data across the wide are a also requires a query processor that can query data sources on demand, receive streamed {XML} data from them, and combine and restructure the data into new {XML} output - while providing good performance for both batch-oriented and ad hoc, interactive queries. This is the goal of the Tukwila data integration system, the first system that focuses on network-bound, dynamic {XML} data sources. In contrast to previous approaches, which must read, parse, and often store entire {XML} objects before querying them, Tukwila can return query results even as the data is streaming into the system. Tukwila is built with a new system architecture that extends adaptive query processing and relational-engine techniques into the {XML} realm, as facilitated by a pair of operators that incrementally evaluate a query's input path expressions as data is read. In this paper, we describe the Tukwila architecture and its novel aspects, and we experimentally demonstrate that Tukwila provides better overall query performance and faster initial answers than existing systems, and has excellent scalability.},

These limitations make traditional database systems inappropriate for queries over sensors. We present the Fjords architecture for managing multiple queries over many sensors, and show how it can be used to limit sensor resource demands while maintaining high query throughput. We evaluate our architecture using traces from a network of traffic sensors deployed on Interstate 80 near Berkeley and present performance results that show how query throughput, communication costs, and power consumption are necessarily coupled in sensor environments.},

In this paper, we present a novel method for processing pipelined join plans that dynamically arranges the join order of both inner and outer-most tables at run-time. We extend the Eddies concept of "moments of symmetry" to reorder indexed nested-loop joins, the join method used by all commercial {DBMSs} for building pipelined query plans for applications for which low latencies are crucial. Unlike row-routing techniques, our approach achieves adaptability by changing the pipeline itself which avoids the bookkeeping and routing decision associated with each row. Operator selectivities monitored during query execution are used to change the execution plan at strategic points, and the change of execution plans utilizes a novel and efficient technique for avoiding duplicates in the query results. Our prototype implementation in a commercial {DBMS} shows a query execution speedup of up to 8 times.},

	abstract = {Efficiently processing queries against very large graphs is an important research topic largely driven by emerging real world applications, as diverse as {XML} databases, {GIS,} web mining, social network analysis, ontologies, and bioinformatics. In particular, graph reachability has attracted a lot of research attention as reachability queries are not only common on graph databases, but they also serve as fundamental operations for many other graph queries. The main idea behind answering reachability queries in graphs is to build indices based on reachability labels. Essentially, each vertex in the graph is assigned with certain labels such that the reachability between any two vertices can be determined by their labels. Several approaches have been proposed for building these reachability labels; among them are interval labeling (tree cover) and 2-hop labeling. However, due to the large number of vertices in many real world graphs (some graphs can easily contain millions of vertices), the computational cost and (index) size of the labels using existing methods would prove too expensive to be practical. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph structure, referred to as path-tree, to help labeling very large graphs. The path-tree cover is a spanning subgraph of G in a tree shape. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically the effectiveness of our new approaches.},

We show that our design provides significant performance benefits over existing approaches to evaluating continuous queries, not only because of its adaptivity, but also because of the aggressive cross-query sharing of work and space that it enables. By breaking the abstraction of shared relational algebra expressions, our Telegraph {CACQ} implementation is able to share physical operators --- both selections and join state --- at a very fine grain. We augment these features with a grouped-filter index to simultaneously evaluate multiple selection predicates. We include measurements of the performance of our core system, along with a comparison to existing continuous query approaches.},

Digraph G* = {(V,} E*) is the reflexive, transitive closure of G if (v, u) ∈ E* iff there is a path from v to u in G. If we store it as a matrix, O(n2) space is required, not suitable for large graphs. In this paper, we present a new method to reduce the space overhead to O(bn), where b is the G's width, defined to be the size of a largest node subset U of G such that for every pair of nodes u, v ∈ U, there does not exist a path from u to v or from v to u. With such a compressed data structure of transitive closure, the time for checking reachability (whether a node is reachable from another node through a path) is bounded by O(logb). In addition, this data structure can be generated in O(be') time, where e' is the size of a subset of E, which contains only those edges (u, v) such that there is no path of length ≥2 connecting u and v. We are able to show that the average value of e' is on the order of O(n1.5). Our method is suitable for both acyclic and cyclic graphs.},

	abstract = {We focus on stream join optimization by exploiting the constraints that are dynamically embedded into data streams to signal the end of transmitting certain attribute values. These constraints are called punctuations. Our stream join operator, {PJoin,} is able to remove no-longer-useful data from the state in a timely manner based on punctuations, thus reducing memory overhead and improving the efficiency of probing. We equip {PJoin} with several alternate strategies for purging the state and for propagating punctuations to benefit down-stream operators. We also present an extensive experimental study to explore the performance gains achieved by purging state as well as the trade-off between different purge strategies. Our experimental results of comparing the performance of {PJoin} with {XJoin,} a stream join operator without a constraint-exploiting mechanism, show that {PJoin} significantly outperforms {XJoin} with regard to both memory overhead and throughput.},

	abstract = {We consider the problem of pipelined filters, where a continuous stream of tuples is processed by a set of commutative filters. Pipelined filters are common in stream applications and capture a large class of multiway stream joins. We focus on the problem of ordering the filters adaptively to minimize processing cost in an environment where stream and filter characteristics vary unpredictably over time. Our core algorithm, {A-Greedy} (for Adaptive Greedy), has strong theoretical guarantees: If stream and filter characteristics were to stabilize, {A-Greedy} would converge to an ordering within a small constant factor of optimal. {(In} experiments {A-Greedy} usually converges to the optimal ordering.) One very important feature of {A-Greedy} is that it monitors and responds to selectivities that are correlated across filters (i.e., that are nonindependent), which provides the strong quality guarantee but incurs run-time overhead. We identify a three-way tradeoff among provable convergence to good orderings, run-time overhead, and speed of adaptivity. We develop a suite of variants of {A-Greedy} that lie at different points on this tradeoff spectrum. We have implemented all our algorithms in the {STREAM} prototype Data Stream Management System and a thorough performance evaluation is presented.},

brings new challenges. In this paper, we design a method based on labelling scheme for structural queries processing on graph-structured

labelling scheme for {DAG} by Rakesh et al., we design labelling schemes to support the judgements of reachability relationships
for general graphs. Based on the labelling schemes, we design graph structural join algorithms to answer the structural queries
with only ancestor-descendant relationship efficiently. For the processing of subgraph query, we design a subgraph join algorithm.
With efficient data structure, the subgraph join algorithm can process subgraph queries with various structures efficiently.
Experimental results show that our algorithms have good performance and scalability.},
